### About
This is the ***Connect Four*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p>Connect Four is a fun game for two players. The players place discs on a vertical board that is 7 columns wide and 6 rows tall. The goal of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs.</p>
