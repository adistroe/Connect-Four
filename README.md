### About
This is the ***Connect Four*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)<br>
This project is a part of the following tracks: [Kotlin Core](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18), [Kotlin Developer](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/3), [Android Development with Kotlin](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/16), [Kotlin Backend Developer (Spring Boot)](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/37)

### Learning outcomes
<p>Connect Four is a fun game for two players. The players place discs on a vertical board that is 7 columns wide and 6 rows tall. The goal of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. In this project, you will develop this game with a number of improvements.</p>
<p>This project will help you understand how to use basic Kotlin components: data structures, conditions and loops. You'll learn how to interface with a program and develop a fun game to play.</p>
